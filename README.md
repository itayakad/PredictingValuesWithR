# PredictingValuesWithR
This in-class project utilizes R to analyze and predict demographic patterns from housing and adult datasets. It involves loading and cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations, and engineering new features. For the housing data, models such as Linear Regression and Regression Trees are used to predict median house values, with a combined model approach reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and improving accuracy. In the adult data analysis, features like `CapitalNet` and `EduNumHours` are created to predict `HoursPerYear` and `marital.status`. The dataset is segmented by relationship status and age to enhance prediction accuracy. Cross-validation is employed to ensure robust model evaluation, demonstrating effective data analysis and modeling techniques to uncover significant demographic trends.
